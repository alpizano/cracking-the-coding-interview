# Cracking the Coding Interview
## Interview Questions
I will be devising my own solutions/algorithms to various questions in the "Cracking the Coding Interview" book by Gayle Laakman. Yes, there is a solutions page however, my approach will be to code from scratch avoiding the solutions until many hours have passed (or I become frustrated enough :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:)

I feel creating the repository and pushing my progress to the remote repo aids in staying consistent, is doing many algorithmic-type leetcode style problems can be very draining for some and the progress can halt fast if there isn't enough stimulation. Thanks for checking out this repository!

## isUnique
